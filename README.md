# Path-to-Conversion-Analyzing-User-Journey
Analyze and interpret sequences of page visits to uncover the most impactful user pathways.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of user journeys on the 365 Data Science platform to identify key pathways that drive user subscriptions. Leveraging real-world data, this analysis focuses on understanding the behaviors and page sequences that lead users from initial exploration to subscription decisions. By mapping user journeys, this project sheds light on the most influential pages, sequences, and interactions that increase the likelihood of conversion, offering valuable insights for optimizing the platformâ€™s design and marketing strategies.

Project Objectives:

1. Analyze and interpret sequences of page visits to uncover the most impactful user pathways.
2. Identify potential drop-off points or unnecessary pages that may hinder a seamless user experience.
3. Utilize Python to create custom tools and functions for an in-depth journey analysis, applying systematic approaches to parse and interpret user behavior data.

Dataset Overview: The user_journey_raw.csv dataset includes:

1. User and Session IDs: Unique identifiers for each user and session.
2. Purchased Plan: Subscription type (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).
3. User Journey String: A sequential log of pages visited in each session, illustrating the journey through the platform.
4. 
This project serves as a foundation for data-driven decisions in user experience design, helping businesses optimize the journey to enhance conversion rates and improve user satisfaction on online learning platforms.
